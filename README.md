Problems from leetcode
1. Pow(x, n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

2. String to Integer (atoi)

Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.

3. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

4. MatchingArrays

A two-dimensional array A os given. Count number of rows that match another one-dimensional array B.

5. PairArifm

Array A (n) is given (n is even). Form an array B (m) whose elements
are the arithmetic means of neighboring pairs of numbers standing nearby in array A. For example, array A
consists of elements 1, 3, 5, -2, 0, 4, 0, 3. The elements of array B are 2; 1.5; 2; 1,5

6. MinusLast

N Ã— m matrix is given. Transform a matrix:
Subtract the last line from all lines except the last one.
